# The CMS for Clinical and Ops teams

CMS are usually associated with Marketing and easily editing content for Social Media. 

It should also be simple for the Ops team to edit things like emails or user information. 

And to make things more complex, Operations workflows require templates for improving communication, integrating with external tools and data sources to make decisions, and allowing a high level of flexibility. In the day to day basis, almost everything is done manually by operators jumping from one UI to another. 

Having composability in the UI, both from Ops point of view and end user is incredible important to reduce friction on the mission critical parts of the process.
